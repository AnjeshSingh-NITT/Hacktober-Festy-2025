A permutation of an array of integers is an arrangement of its members into a sequence or linear order.  

Given an array of integers `nums`, find the **next permutation** of `nums`. The replacement must be **in place** and use only constant extra memory.

The **next permutation** is defined as the next lexicographically greater permutation of its integers. If no such arrangement is possible, rearrange it as the lowest possible order (i.e., sorted in ascending order).

### Example 1:
- Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`  
- Output: `[1,3,2]`

### Example 2:
- Input: `nums = [3,2,1]`  
- Output: `[1,2,3]`

### Example 3:
- Input: `nums = [1,1,5]`  
- Output: `[1,5,1]`
