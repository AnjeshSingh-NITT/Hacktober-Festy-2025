1. How do you prioritize test cases when you have limited time for execution?

2. What techniques would you use to test an API that handles high-volume traffic?

# Pick an App with a REST API Backend

- Send API requests (GET/POST/PUT) to create/update/delete a record.  
- Verify the UI reflects the API changes correctly without page reload.

# Responsive Design Verification

- Test on multiple viewport sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).  
- Validate that menus, buttons, and forms adjust correctly.  
- Capture screenshots for each resolution.
