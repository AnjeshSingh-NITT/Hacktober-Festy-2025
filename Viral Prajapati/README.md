## 2. Merge k Sorted Linked Lists

**Problem:**  
You are given an array of `k` linked-lists, each linked-list is sorted in ascending order.  
Merge all the linked-lists into one sorted linked-list and return it.

### Example 1:
- Input: `lists = [[1,4,5],[1,3,4],[2,6]]`  
- Output: `[1,1,2,3,4,4,5,6]`  
- Explanation: The linked-lists are:
1->4->5,
1->3->4,
2->6

yaml
Copy code
Merging them into one sorted linked list: `1->1->2->3->4->4->5->6`

### Example 2:
- Input: `lists = []`  
- Output: `[]`

### Example 3:
- Input: `lists = [[]]`  
- Output: `[]`

## 3. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array

**Problem:**  
Given an integer array `nums` sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates **in-place** such that each unique element appears only once. Return the number of unique elements in `nums`.

### Example 1:
- Input: `nums = [1,1,2]`  
- Output: `2, nums = [1,2,_]`  
- Explanation: Return `k = 2`, first two elements are 1 and 2. The remaining elements are not important.

### Example 2:
- Input: `nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]`  
- Output: `5, nums = [0,1,2,3,4,_,_,_,_,_]`  
- Explanation: Return `k = 5`, first five elements are `0,1,2,3,4`.
