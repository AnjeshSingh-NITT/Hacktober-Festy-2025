Given two strings `needle` and `haystack`, return the index of the first occurrence of `needle` in `haystack`, or `-1` if `needle` is not part of `haystack`.

### Example 1:
- Input: `haystack = "sadbutsad"`, `needle = "sad"`  
- Output: `0`  
- Explanation: `"sad"` occurs at index 0 and 6. The first occurrence is at index 0, so we return 0.

### Example 2:
- Input: `haystack = "leetcode"`, `needle = "leeto"`  
- Output: `-1`  
- Explanation: `"leeto"` did not occur in `"leetcode"`, so we return -1.
