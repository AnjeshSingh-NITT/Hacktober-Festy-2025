# QA Automation Tasks (Continued)

1. Automate a registration form  
    - Include fields like username, email, phone, and password.  
    - Implement WebDriverWait or FluentWait (avoid Thread.sleep).

2. Exploratory testing  
    - Pick any open-source web application (e.g., a simple ToDo app or demo e-commerce site).  
    - Perform exploratory testing and log at least 5 unique bugs (UI, functional, usability, or accessibility).

# File Upload & Download Testing

- Automate a scenario where a user uploads a file and downloads a generated report.  
    - Verify file type restrictions, file size restrictions, and proper download location.  
    - Validate that the downloaded file content matches expectations.
