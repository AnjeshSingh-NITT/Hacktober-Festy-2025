## 4. Zigzag Conversion

The string `"PAYPALISHIRING"` is written in a zigzag pattern on a given number of rows like this:

```

P   A   H   N
A P L S I I G
Y   I   R

````

Then read line by line: `"PAHNAPLSIIGYIR"`

Write the code that will take a string and make this conversion given a number of rows:

```cpp
string convert(string s, int numRows);
````

### Example 1:

* Input: `s = "PAYPALISHIRING"`, `numRows = 3`
* Output: `"PAHNAPLSIIGYIR"`

### Example 2:

* Input: `s = "PAYPALISHIRING"`, `numRows = 4`
* Output: `"PINALSIGYAHRPI"`
* Explanation:

  ```
  P     I    N
  A   L S  I G
  Y A   H R
  P     I
  ```

### Example 3:

* Input: `s = "A"`, `numRows = 1`
* Output: `"A"`
