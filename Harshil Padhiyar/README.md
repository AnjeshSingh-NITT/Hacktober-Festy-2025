## 4. Implement myAtoi(string s)

Convert a string to a 32-bit signed integer.   

### Example 1:
- Input: `s = "42"`  
- Output: `42`

### Example 2:
- Input: `s = " -042"`  
- Output: `-42`

### Example 3:
- Input: `s = "1337c0d3"`  
- Output: `1337`

### Example 4:
- Input: `s = "0-1"`  
- Output: `0`

### Example 5:
- Input: `s = "words and 987"`  
- Output: `0`

## 5. Longest Palindromic Substring

Given a string `s`, return the longest palindromic substring.

### Example 1:
- Input: `s = "babad"`  
- Output: `"bab"`  
- Explanation: `"aba"` is also valid.

### Example 2:
- Input: `s = "cbbd"`  
- Output: `"bb"`

## 6. Add Two Numbers Represented by Linked Lists

Assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

### Example 1:
- Input: `l1 = [2,4,3]`, `l2 = [5,6,4]`  
- Output: `[7,0,8]`  
- Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.

### Example 2:
- Input: `l1 = [0]`, `l2 = [0]`  
- Output: `[0]`

### Example 3:
- Input: `l1 = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9]`, `l2 = [9,9,9,9]`  
- Output: `[8,9,9,9,0,0,0,1]`
