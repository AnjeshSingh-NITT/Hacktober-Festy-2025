## 2. Regular Expression Matching

**Problem:**  
Given an input string `s` and a pattern `p`, implement regular expression matching with support for `.` and `*` where:

- `.` Matches any single character.  
- `*` Matches zero or more of the preceding element.  

The matching should cover the entire input string (not partial).

### Example 1:
- Input: `s = "aa"`, `p = "a"`  
- Output: `false`  
- Explanation: `"a"` does not match the entire string `"aa"`.

### Example 2:
- Input: `s = "aa"`, `p = "a*"`  
- Output: `true`  
- Explanation: `'*'` means zero or more of the preceding element, `'a'`. Therefore, by repeating `'a'` once, it becomes `"aa"`.

### Example 3:
- Input: `s = "ab"`, `p = ".*"`  
- Output: `true`  
- Explanation: `".*"` means "zero or more (`*`) of any character (`.`)".

## 3. Palindrome Number

**Problem:**  
Given an integer `x`, return `true` if `x` is a palindrome, and `false` otherwise.

### Example 1:
- Input: `x = 121`  
- Output: `true`  
- Explanation: `121` reads as `121` from left to right and from right to left.

### Example 2:
- Input: `x = -121`  
- Output: `false`  
- Explanation: From left to right, it reads `-121`. From right to left, it becomes `121-`. Therefore, it is not a palindrome.

### Example 3:
- Input: `x = 10`  
- Output: `false`  
- Explanation: Reads `01` from right to left. Therefore, it is not a palindrome.
