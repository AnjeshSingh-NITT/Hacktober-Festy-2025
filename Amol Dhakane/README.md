# QA Automation Tasks

1. Verify validation errors  
    - Check for empty fields, invalid email format, and short password.  
    - Write a generic reusable function that accepts field locators and expected error messages.

2. Automate form submission  
    - Handle scenarios where the success message appears randomly after 1â€“5 seconds.  
    - Document with clear steps to reproduce, actual vs expected results, and screenshots.

3. Automate verification of a dynamic table  
    - Verify that specific data exists in the table.  
    - Implement a reusable method to search for any value in any column.
