## 4. Median of Two Sorted Arrays

**Problem:**  
Given two sorted arrays `nums1` and `nums2` of size `m` and `n` respectively, return the median of the two sorted arrays.  
The overall run time complexity should be **O(log (m+n))**.

### Example 1:
- Input:  
  `nums1 = [1,3]`, `nums2 = [2]`  
- Output:  
  `2.00000`  
- Explanation:  
  Merged array = `[1,2,3]` and median is `2`.

### Example 2:
- Input:  
  `nums1 = [1,2]`, `nums2 = [3,4]`  
- Output:  
  `2.50000`  
- Explanation:  
  Merged array = `[1,2,3,4]` and median is `(2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5`.

## 5. Reverse Integer

**Problem:**  
Given a signed 32-bit integer `x`, return `x` with its digits reversed.  
If reversing `x` causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range `[-2³¹, 2³¹ - 1]`, then return `0`.  

Assume the environment does not allow you to store 64-bit integers (signed or unsigned).

### Example 1:
- Input: `123`  
- Output: `321`

### Example 2:
- Input: `-123`  
- Output: `-321`

### Example 3:
- Input: `120`  
- Output: `21`
